## Introduction

Amidst the diverse applications, such as airport security, shopping mall monitoring, and public space surveillance, this project delves into the challenges of detecting pedestrians and tracking their movements in surveillance footage.

## Project Overview

The "Detection and Tracking of Pedestrians" project, developed as part of the Visual Computing course (CVI) in the academic year 2020/2021, presents a system for detecting pedestrians and tracing their movements within surveillance video footage. This endeavor showcases the synergy of computer vision techniques and video analysis, contributing to advancements in surveillance and crowd behavior analysis.

The project is centered around designing and implementing a video surveillance system that can accurately detect pedestrians and track their trajectories across consecutive frames. By harnessing the power of computer vision, the system identifies key points of interest within the video and traces the movement patterns of pedestrians over time. This application has implications for security, crowd management, and public safety.
